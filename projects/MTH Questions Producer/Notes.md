Consider adding a function that allows the user to assess the number of days to study compared with the number of problems available and gives a value that the user would be required to do per day. 


# To Do
 - Need a new function or check of some kind that ensures values in the review section are not also being output in the non-review section. I only want unique values, and with the current model, if I select 0, I get unique values in each list. But, when looking at these lists in totality, there is a lot of the same values. 
 - Need a new function that adds the unit to the items in the list
 - Need a new function that sorts the list (my intuition says that this will need to be sorted before adding the unit)
